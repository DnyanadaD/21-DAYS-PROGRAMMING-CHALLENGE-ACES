Block and Extend Tags:-
A template system cannot be complete without template inheritance. 
Meaning when we are designing your templates, 
we should have a main template with holes that the child's template will fill according to his own need, 
like a page might need a special css for the selected tab.

Let’s change the hello.html template to inherit from a main_template.html.
-----------------------------------------------------------
main_template.html

<html>
   <head>
      
      <title>
         {% block title %}Page Title{% endblock %}
      </title>
      
   </head>
	
   <body>
   
      {% block content %}
         Body content
      {% endblock %}
      
   </body>
</html>


----------------------------------------------------------
hello.html

{% extends "main_template.html" %}
{% block title %}My Hello Page{% endblock %}
{% block content %}

Hello World!!!<p>Today is {{today}}</p>
We are
{% if today.day == 1 %}

the first day of month.
{% elif today.day == 30 %}

the last day of month.
{% else %}

I don't know.
{%endif%}

<p>
   {% for day in days_of_week %}
   {{day}}
</p>

{% endfor %}
{% endblock %}

-----------------------------------------------------------
In the above example, on calling /myapp/hello we will still get the same result as before 
but now we rely on extends and block to refactor our code −

In the main_template.html we define blocks using the tag block. 
The title block will contain the page title and the content block will have the page main content. 
In home.html we use extends to inherit from the main_template.html then we fill the block define above (content and title).

Comment Tag:-
The comment tag helps to define comments into templates, not HTML comments, they won’t appear in HTML page. 
It can be useful for documentation or just commenting a line of code.
