Django supports the MVC pattern. 
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
Django also have the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern.
The Model-View-Template (MVT) is slightly different from MVC.
the main difference between the two patterns is that Django itself takes care of the Controller part 
(Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View), leaving us with the template.
The template is a HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL).
Django is written in 100% pure Python code.

Django supports several major database engines:-
    *  MySQL 
    *  PostgreSQL 
    *  SQLite 3 
    *  Oracle 
    *  MongoDb 
    *  GoogleAppEngine Datastore 


 Creating Project:-
 To create a project Whether we are on Windows or Linux, just get a terminal or a cmd prompt and navigate to the place you want your project to be created

  After craeting project folder as Myproject we get the following structure:-
 
  Myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
      __init__.py
      settings.py
      urls.py
      wsgi.py


The Project Structure
The “myproject” folder is just project container, it actually contains two elements −

manage.py − This file is kind of project local django-admin for interacting with project via command line.
              To get a full list of command accessible via manage.py we can use the code −

                 $ python manage.py help

The “myproject” subfolder − This folder is the actual python package of project.
     
 It contains four files −

    __init__.py − Just for python, treat this folder as package.

    settings.py − As the name indicates,  project settings.

   urls.py − All links of  project and the function to call. A kind of ToC of project.

    wsgi.py − If we need to deploy our project over WSGI.
