syncdb will create necessary tables or collections depending on db type,necessary for the admin interface to run. 
Even if wedon't have a superuser,we will be prompted to create one.

If we already have a superuser or have forgotten it still we can always create one using the following code −
                   $ python manage.py createsuperuser


Now to start the Admin Interface, 
we need to make sure we have configured a URL for our admin interface. 
Open the myproject/url.py and you should have something like −

      from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
      from django.contrib import admin
      admin.autodiscover()
      urlpatterns = patterns('',
      # Examples:
      # url(r'^$', 'myproject.views.home', name = 'home'),
      # url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls')),
      url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
      )

To run the server:-
$ python manage.py runserver

And sour admin interface is accessible at: http://****************/admin/
