Creating Views:-
A view function is simply a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. 
This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, etc. 
Example: You use view to create web pages, 
note that we need to associate a view to a URL to see it as a web page.

In Django, views have to be created in the app  as views.py file.

Simple View:-
We will create a simple view in myapp to say "welcome to my app!"
 
from django.http import HttpResponse
def hello(request):
   text = """<h1>welcome to my app !</h1>"""
   return HttpResponse(text)

In this view, we use HttpResponse to render the HTML 
(as we have probably noticed we have the HTML hard coded in the view). 
To see this view as a page we just need to map it to a URL.

Django supports the MVT pattern so to make the precedent view, we will need −
A template: myapp/templates/hello.html 

And now our view will look like :−

from django.shortcuts import render
def hello(request):
   return render(request, "myapp/template/hello.html", {})  

Views can also accept parameters −

from django.http import HttpResponse
def hello(request, number):
   text = "<h1>welcome to my app number %s!</h1>"% number
   return HttpResponse(text)

When linked to a URL, the page will display the number passed as a parameter.
