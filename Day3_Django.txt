A project is a sum of many applications. 

Every application has an objective and can be reused into another project.

Create an Application:-
Following command will create application:-
            $ python manage.py startapp myapp

myapp is application name

following are the folders in myapp:-
   __init__.py
   admin.py
   models.py
   tests.py
   views.py

__init__.py − Just to make sure python handles this folder as a package.
admin.py − This file helps you make the app modifiable in the admin interface.
models.py − This is where all the application models are stored.
tests.py − This is where your unit tests are.
ssviews.py − This is where your application views are.

At this stage we have "myapp" application, now we need to register it with our Django project "myproject". To do so, update INSTALLED_APPS tuple in the settings.py file of your project (adding app name)−
INSTALLED_APPS = (
   'django.contrib.admin',
   'django.contrib.auth',
   'django.contrib.contenttypes',
   'django.contrib.sessions',
   'django.contrib.messages',
   'django.contrib.staticfiles',
   'myapp',)

Django provides a ready-to-use user interface for administrative activities.
